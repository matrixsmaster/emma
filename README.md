# EMMA - A Delphi port of llama2.c

This project is a slightly modified port of llama2.c

It is inteded to be built with Delphi 7 in Windows XP.

I can not guarantee that it can be compiled with a newer version of Delphi.

You'll need VNA model files to run EMMA: [HF repo](https://huggingface.co/sciloaf/emma-tiny_stories-quant)


## Why?

First of all - why not?

Second - I wanted to run some LLMs on my retro setups. This is just one of my steps along this path.
